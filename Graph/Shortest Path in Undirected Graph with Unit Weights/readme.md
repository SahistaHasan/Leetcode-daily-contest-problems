In every iteration, pick up the front() node, and then traverse for its adjacent nodes.  For every adjacent node, we will relax the distance to the adjacent node if (dist[node] + 1 < dist[adjNode]). Here dist[node] means the distance taken to reach the current node, and ‘1’ is the edge weight between the node and the adjNode. We will relax the edges if this distance is shorter than the previously taken distance. Every time a distance is updated for the adjacent node, we push that into the Queue with the increased distance.
